# Getting Started
First, ensure you have installed the dependencies required to run the python program. The dependencies are stored in *requirements.txt*. To do so, install all files to a directory on your computer. Then, open a terminal in that directory and simply use

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will ensure you have all dependencies.
